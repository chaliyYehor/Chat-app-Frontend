# Pulse

Pulse is the frontend for a pet project with real-time chat and voice and video calls. The backend is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/chaliyYehor/Chat-app-Backend); the deployed frontend is at [pulse.erxxue.dev](https://pulse.erxxue.dev).

## Stack

React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query, Socket.IO Client, and LiveKit.

## Requirements

Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+, and a running instance of the [backend](https://github.com/chaliyYehor/Chat-app-Backend).

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chaliyYehor/Chat-app-Frontend.git
cd Chat-app-Frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` with the required service URLs, then run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

- `VITE_SERVER_URL`: backend base URL for REST requests, authentication, and Socket.IO.
- `VITE_LIVEKIT_URL`: LiveKit server URL used to join calls.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: run TypeScript project builds and create the production bundle.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: preview the production bundle locally.

## Structure

- `src/api`: REST requests to the backend using Axios.
- `src/components`: shared and page-specific UI components.
- `src/features`: chat event hooks and feature logic.
- `src/hooks`: reusable React hooks.
- `src/lib`: authentication client and utility functions.
- `src/pages`: route page components.
- `src/schemas`: Zod schemas for forms and API data.
- `src/store`: Redux store and slices.
- `src/webRTC`: LiveKit room instance; call pages get credentials through Socket.IO and connect with LiveKit React components.

The app uses REST for HTTP API requests and Socket.IO at `/ws` for realtime events. Voice and video media connections use LiveKit.

## API

The API documentation is served by the [backend repository](https://github.com/chaliyYehor/Chat-app-Backend) at its `/docs` path.

## Deployment

The frontend is deployed on Vercel. The existing `vercel.json` rewrite sends all paths to `/` for client-side routing.
